The theoretical foundations for the Bayesian clinical trials has been long established \cite{Cornfield1966}~\cite{Cornfield1966a}~\cite{Neyman1967}. A comprehensive framework for interpretation of results was developed through specifying prior distributions that are naturally and intuitively related to the research objectives (e.g. skeptical and enthusiastic priors) \cite{Freedman1989}~\cite{Freedman1992}~\cite{Spiegelhalter1993}~\cite{Spiegelhalter1994}~\cite{Fayers1997}.

There is still potential for further utilization of Bayesian methods in the clinical trial setting. While the framework for interpretation of Bayesian clinical trials is well developed, the details of specifying prior distributions in a natural and intuitive way is lacking. This paper presents a structured or default way to determine prior distributions based on the trial design. Our major contribution is to present methods for the default or automatic selection of prior distributions in a way that is applicable to a wide array of clinical trial designs.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Bayesian methodology is widely developed.
\item It has been applied (cite).
\item The current perspective is that Bayesian methodology is only valid when Frequentist methods are insufficient, including where enrollment is challenging (rare diseases, pediatric studies)
\item Our contribution is to show that Bayesian methods are applicable to all clinical trials. This is shown by highlighting their improved interpretation and showing their use in varied and complicated situations.
\end{enumerate}

%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Preliminaries}\label{sec:preliminaries}
\subsubsection{Bayesian hypothesis testing using posterior probabilities}
Consider a one-arm trial with a single measured outcome per patient. The objective is to make inference on a single unknown quantity. Let $\mathbf{D}$ be a random variable representing the data collected in the trial with density $p(\mathbf{D}|\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the parameter of interest with sample space $\theta\in\Theta$. 
%
For example, in the context of a simple binary outcome (e.g., objective response to treatment) based on sample size $n$, $\mathbf{D} = \left(y_1,...,y_n\right)$ may correspond to the $n$ indicators for whether or not subjects responded to a treatment and $\theta\in[0,1]$ may correspond to an assumed common probability of response.

Formal Bayesian hypothesis testing requires the specification of prior probabilities on the hypotheses (e.g., $p(H_i)$ for $i=0,1$)
and prior distributions for $\theta$ for each hypothesis (e.g. $\pi\left(\theta \big| H_i\right)$ for $i=0,1$). 
%
Consider the hypotheses $H_0:\theta\in\Theta_{0}$ versus $H_1:\theta\in\Theta_{1}$ where $\Theta_{0}\bigcup \Theta_{1} = \Theta$ and $\Theta_{0} \bigcap \Theta_{1} = \emptyset$. 

The posterior probability of hypothesis $H_i$ is 
\begin{align}
p(H_i|\mathbf{D})&=\frac{p(\mathbf{D}|H_i)\cdot p(H_i)}{p(\mathbf{D}|H_0)\cdot p(H_0)+p(\mathbf{D}|H_1)\cdot p(H_1)}\\
&=\frac{\int_{\Theta_i} p(\mathbf{D}|\theta,H_i)\pi(\theta|H_i)d\theta\cdot p(H_i)}{p(\mathbf{D}|H_0)\cdot p(H_0)+p(\mathbf{D}|H_1)\cdot p(H_1)}.
\end{align}

The posterior probability of the \textit{event defining $H_i$} is
\begin{align}\label{eq:equation1}
P(\theta\in\Theta_i|\mathbf{D})
&=\int_{\Theta_i}p(\theta|\mathbf{D})d\theta\\
&=\frac{\int_{\Theta_i}p(\mathbf{D}|\theta)\pi (\theta)d\theta}{\int_{\Theta}p(\mathbf{D}|\theta)\pi(\theta) d\theta}\\
&=\frac{\int_{\Theta_i}p(\mathbf{D}|\theta)\pi (\theta|\theta\in\Theta_i)d\theta\cdot P(\theta\in\Theta_i)}{\int_{\Theta}p(\mathbf{D}|\theta)\pi(\theta) d\theta},
\end{align}
where $P(\theta\in\Theta_i)=\int_{\Theta_i}\pi(\theta)d\theta$. 

When $p(H_i) =P(\theta\in\Theta_i)$ and 
$\pi\left(\theta \big| H_i\right) = \pi\left(\theta\big|\theta \in \Theta_i\right)$ for $i=0,1$,
it follows that the posterior probability of the event defining the alternative hypothesis and the posterior
probability of the alternative hypothesis are equivalent. 

Consistent with the specifications of $p(H_i)$ and $\pi\left(\theta \big| H_i\right)$ as described above, in what follows we will refer to 
the quantity $P(\theta\in\Theta_1|\mathbf{D})$ as the posterior probability of $H_i$ for ease of exposition.

\subsubsection{Compelling level of evidence}
Define $\epsilon$ as the \textit{residual uncertainty} of $H_i$ being true relative to the competing hypothesis, and define $1-\epsilon\in(0,1)$ as the threshold for \textit{a compelling level of evidence} that some claim about $\theta$ is true. We say that an individual is \textit{all but convinced} that $H_i$ is true given the observed data if they believe that
\begin{align}\label{eq:compellingevidence}
P(\theta\in\Theta_i|\mathbf{D})> 1-\epsilon.
\end{align} 

Furthermore, $1-\epsilon\in(0,1)$ can be used as a threshold for \textit{a compelling a priori belief} that some claim about $\theta$ is true before the beginning of the trial. We say that an individual is \textit{all but convinced} that $H_i$ is true a priori if they believe that
\begin{align}\label{eq:compellingapriori}
P(\theta\in\Theta_i)>1-\epsilon.
\end{align} 

\subsubsection{Skeptical and Enthusiastic Monitoring Priors}\label{sec:MP}
Continuing the trial setup from Section \ref{sec:preliminaries}, suppose every subject receives active treatment during the follow-up period from enrollment to study completion. The length of follow-up is the same for each subject. Subjects are enrolled progressively such that there is a time when there are both subjects with completed outcomes and subjects undergoing follow-up. In this paper we introduce two types of prior: monitoring and inference priors. 

The purpose of monitoring priors to is help answer the question ``Is the evidence compelling enough to end the trial early?'' Monitoring priors are used for interim analyses on the data from subjects who completed follow-up while additional outcomes are pending. A promising interim result that shows clear efficacy of the treatment would justify stopping the enrollment of additional subjects, while enrolled subjects would continue receiving the presumed effective treatment during the follow-up period. A discouraging interim result that shows clear futility of the treatment would justify stopping the enrollment of additional subjects, and may call for enrolled patients undergoing follow-up to stop receiving the presumed ineffective treatment. 

To have either efficacy or futility to be ``clear" the evidence must be convincing to individuals with diverse opinions of $\theta$. The judgment of efficacy must be convincing even to an individual who was initially skeptical about the benefit of the treatment. Likewise, the judgment of futility must be convincing to an individual was initially optimistic. For this reason monitoring priors generally represent relatively extreme (but still plausible) beliefs about $\theta$. If a skeptic has become confident that the treatment is efficacious, 
that implies essentially anyone with some degree of equipoise would also be convinced, hence individuals with diverse opinions have a consensus. Alternatively, if an enthusiast has become convinced that the treatment is ineffective, then essentially everyone will share that opinion. 

%It has been said that ``the purpose of a trial is to collect data that bring to conclusive consensus at termination opinions that had been diverse and indecisive at the \textit{outset}" (Kass and Greenhouse (1989), emphasis added). 
%
%Such opinions may be characterized through specification of different priors that vary in terms of the set of values of $\theta$ that are most likely and the mass allocated to specific regions of the parameter space (e.g., $\theta\in\Theta_i$).
%\textcolor{orange}{There is only one research objective and that is to determine which of the two hypotheses is likely to be true.}
%

Monitoring priors will be defined based on the concepts of compelling a prior belief defined in Section \ref{sec:preliminaries}. Continuing the trial setup from Section \ref{sec:preliminaries}, suppose that $\theta$ corresponds to a probability of desired response, and the null hypothesis is $H_0:\theta\leq\theta_0$ where $\theta_0$ is the expected null response among untreated subjects. 
%
Let $\theta_1>\theta_0$ be a highly efficacious response probability.
%

We define an enthusiastic prior $\pi_{E}(\theta)$ as a prior that is centered around $\theta_1$ and reflects the belief of an individual that is \textit{all but convinced} that $H_i$ is true a priori, that is, 
\begin{align}\label{eq:enthprior}
P(\theta >\theta_0| \pi_{E})>1-\epsilon.
\end{align} 

Consider a similarly defined skeptical prior $\pi_{S}(\theta)$ that is centered around $\theta_0$ and reflects the belief of an individual that is \textit{all but convinced} that $H_0$ is true a priori, that is, $P(\theta\leq\theta_0| \pi_{S})>1-\epsilon$. Having this belief demonstrates such an extreme disbelief in the possibility of a positive effect that conducting the trial at all would be viewed as dubious. This is analogous to specifying a prior model probability on $H_0$ that is $1-\epsilon$ and that is not consistent with their being clinical equipoise about the hypotheses; such extreme skepticism is not rational if a trial is to be conducted. 

Instead, we define the skeptical prior $\pi_S(\theta)$ to be centered around $\theta_0$ and reflects the belief of an individual that is \textit{all but convinced} that a highly efficacious response probability is unlikely, that is,  
\begin{align}\label{eq:skptprior}
P(\theta>\theta_1| \pi_{S})<\epsilon.
\end{align}

The enthusiastic and skeptical conditions defined in (\ref{eq:enthprior}), (\ref{eq:skptprior}) will be referred to as tail-probability constraints.

\subsubsection{Criteria for Early Stoppage}
The use of monitoring based on changing the opinion of skeptical and enthusiastic priors has been described as overcoming a handicap (\cite{Freedman1989}) and providing a brake (\cite{Fayers1997}) on the premature termination of trials, or constructing ``an adversary who will need to be disillusioned by the data to stop further experimentation" (\cite{Spiegelhalter1994}). Early termination of enrollment is appropriate if diverse prior opinions about $\theta$ would be in agreement given the interim data (e.g. the skeptical and enthusiastic person reach the same conclusion). 

The skeptic, whose prior belief is reflected in (\ref{eq:skptprior}), becomes convinced the treatment is effective if there is compelling evidence that $\theta>\theta_0$ is true (\ref{eq:compellingevidence}), that is, 
\begin{align}
P(\theta<\theta_1|\pi_{S})>1-\epsilon \Rightarrow P(\theta>\theta_0| \mathbf{D},\pi_{S})>1-\epsilon.
\end{align}

Consider $\theta<\frac{\theta_0+\theta_1}{2}$ to be a response that is less than the highly efficacious response probability $\theta_1$. The enthusiast, whose prior belief is reflected in (\ref{eq:enthprior}), becomes convinced the treatment is ineffective, or not as effective as anticipated, if there is compelling evidence that $\theta<\frac{\theta_0+\theta_1}{2}$, that is, 
\begin{align}
P(\theta>\theta_0|\pi_{E})>1-\epsilon\Rightarrow P\left(\theta<\frac{\theta_0+\theta_1}{2}\Big| \mathbf{D},\pi_{E}\right)>1-\epsilon.
\end{align}
%
\subsection{Monitoring Prior Specification}
\subsubsection{The Generalized Normal Family of Distributions}
The enthusiastic and skeptical priors defined in (\ref{eq:enthprior}), (\ref{eq:skptprior}) each have a required center (modal value) and tail-probability constraint, however, there are still many ways to parameterize such distributions. The specification of the mean and variance of a normal distribution completely specifies the modal value and tail-probability constraints, and is therefore sufficient for defining enthusiastic and skeptical priors. However, for additional flexibility, we will consider the generalized normal distribution for prior specification.

Consider the univariate generalized normal kernel 
\begin{align}\label{eq:generalizednormalkernel}
\exp\left\{-\left(\frac{|\theta-\mu|}{\sigma}\right)^\beta\right\}
\end{align} where $\mu\in\mathbb{R}$ is a location parameter, $\sigma>0$ is a scale parameter, and $\beta>0$ is a shape parameter. Note that $\beta=2$ corresponds to the normal distribution. 

In the case of $\beta=2$, this distribution is symmetric around $\mu$ and the combination of location and scale parameter can accommodate the required modal value and tail area probability requirement (i.e. (\ref{eq:enthprior}), (\ref{eq:skptprior})). 

The modification of $\beta$ can be used to concentrate or flatten the distribution around the modal value. If $\beta<2$ then the distribution becomes more peaked relative to a normal distribution, and if $\beta>2$ then the distribution becomes flatter. Examples of skeptical and enthusiastic priors for a single parameter $\theta$ based on the trial from Section \ref{sec:preliminaries} are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:figure1}. The location and shape parameters are pre-specified, and the scale parameter is chosen to satisfy the tail-probability constraints (\ref{eq:enthprior}), (\ref{eq:skptprior}).

%Continuing the trial setup from Section \ref{sec:preliminaries}, it is necessary to truncate the generalized normal distribution to the range $[0,1]$. When truncated to the unit interval, this density becomes
%\begin{align}\label{eq:generalized_normal_univariate}
%\pi(\theta)\propto \exp\left\{-\frac{|\theta-\mu|}{\sigma}^\beta\right\} I(\theta\in[0,1]).
%\end{align} 
%

\label{fig:figure1}
\end{figure}

%
\subsubsection{Application to higher dimensions}
The generalized normal distribution can be used to parameterize skeptical and enthusiastic priors for trials with multiple unknown quantities of interest. Suppose the trial from Section \ref{sec:preliminaries} has added a control arm, and let $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$ be the response proportions for a control and treatment group respectively. Suppose that the risk difference $\theta_1-\theta_0$ is of interest. Let $\delta_0$ denote a null risk difference and $\delta_1$ denote a highly efficacious risk difference.

Consider the following representation of the joint prior for $\theta_1$ and $\theta_0$:
\begin{align}
\pi(\theta_0,\theta_1)=&\pi(\theta_0)\times\pi(\theta_1|\theta_0). \label{eq:generalized_normal_joint}
\end{align}

Each of these components can be represented in the form of (\ref{eq:generalizednormalkernel}) by
\begin{align}
\pi(\theta_0)\propto&\exp\left\{-\left(\frac{|\theta_0-\mu_0|}{\sigma_0}\right)^{\beta_0}\right\} \label{eq:genNormPlacebo}\\
\pi(\theta_1|\theta_0)\propto&\exp\left\{-\left(\frac{|(\theta_1-\theta_0)-\delta|}{\sigma_1}\right)^{\beta_1}\right\}f(\theta_0). \label{eq:genNormRd}
\end{align}

The component $\pi(\theta_0)$ reflects prior opinion about the response rate in the placebo group, and the component $\pi(\theta_1|\theta_0)$ can be used to express pessimism or optimism in the difference in proportions $\theta_1 - \theta_0$. 

The enthusiastic prior condition from (\ref{eq:enthprior}) become
\begin{align}\label{eq:ex2enthcondition}
P(\theta_1-\theta_0>\delta_0)=1-\epsilon.
\end{align}

The skeptical prior condition from (\ref{eq:skptprior}) become
\begin{align}\label{eq:ex2skptcondition}
P(\theta_1-\theta_0<\delta_1)=1-\epsilon.
\end{align}


Examples of skeptical and enthusiastic priors are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:figure5}.

\subsection{Mixture Inference Priors}
\subsubsection{Definition}
The purpose of the inference prior is to synthesize the posterior inferences from the a priori diverse perspectives to facilitate interpretation of the data once it has been obtained. In this paper we propose using an inference prior that is a combination of the skeptical and enthusiastic priors that were used for monitoring.

The skeptical and enthusiastic monitoring priors defined in Section~\ref{sec:MP} represent extreme but plausible beliefs about $\theta$.
%
While analysis with these priors provides a rational perspective from which one can determine whether interim data are sufficient 
to cease enrolling patients, the a priori belief of most stakeholders will likely fall somewhere in between.
%
Thus, when it interpreting the final data once in hand, intermediate perspectives should be considered.
%
To that end, we define an inference prior as a mixture prior constructed by mixing the monitoring priors.
%
Formally, the inference prior associated with mixing weight $\omega$ is given by
\begin{align}\label{eq:inference_prior}
\pi_{I}\left(\theta\right)=\omega\cdot\pi_{S}\left(\theta\right)+(1-\omega) \cdot \pi_E\left(\theta\right),
\end{align}
where $\omega\in[0,1]$. 
%
The specification of $\omega$ is done a priori, and the value $\omega=1/2$ will be referred to as an agnostic inference prior since it gives equal weight to the skeptical and enthusiastic prior.
%
%\textcolor{green}{
%If I'm not mistaken $\omega_0$ might be a better label for the prior mixing weight and then you could use $\omega\left(\mathbf{D}\right)$ in the expression
%below to represent the posterior mixing weight (which will depend on marginal likelihoods under the two priors). 
%%
%The notation $p(\pi_S|\mathbf{D})$ is not well-defined and will be confusing to reviewers. In my proposal you would use $\omega_0$.
%}
%%
%In particular,
%\begin{align}\label{eq:omega_formula}
%\omega=p(\pi_S|\mathbf{D})=\frac{p(\mathbf{D}|\pi_S)p(\pi_S)}{p(\mathbf{D}|\pi_S)p(\pi_S)+p(\mathbf{D}|\pi_E)p(\pi_E)}
%\end{align}
%where $p(\pi_S)+p(\pi_E)=1$. 
%%
%The quantities $p(\pi_E)$ and $p(\pi_S)$ reflect prior belief in the distribution of $\theta$. 
%%
%A default option is $p(\pi_S)=p(\pi_E)=\frac{1}{2}$. 

The distribution of $\theta$ using the inference 
prior, $p(\theta|\mathbf{D},\pi_I)$, will be used to compute summaries of $\theta$ such as the posterior mean and quantiles. The posterior distribution for $\theta$ using (\ref{eq:inference_prior}) is
\begin{align}
p(\theta|\mathbf{D},\pi_I)&=\hat{\omega}\cdot p(\theta|\mathbf{D},\pi_S)+(1-\hat{\omega})\cdot p(\theta|\mathbf{D},\pi_E)
\end{align}
where the updated mixing weight is
\begin{align}
\hat{\omega}&=\frac{\omega\cdot p(\mathbf{D}|\pi_S)}{\omega\cdot p(\mathbf{D}|\pi_S)+(1-\omega)\cdot p(\mathbf{D}|\pi_E)}
\end{align}
where $p(\mathbf{D}|\pi_S)=\int p(\mathbf{D}|\theta)\pi_S(\theta)d\theta$ and $p(\mathbf{D}|\pi_E)=\int p(\mathbf{D}|\theta)\pi_S(\theta)d\theta$. 

%
%Choosing $\omega=1/2$ for an equal mixture of $\pi_S$ and $\pi_E$ corresponds to an inference prior that equally weights the skeptical and enthusiastic opinions. Define $p(\mathbf{D}|\pi(\theta))=\int p(\mathbf{D}|\theta)\pi(\theta)d\theta$ to be the marginal likelihood for the data given the prior $\pi(\theta)$. Choosing $\omega$ based on posterior model probabilities of the null and alternative hypotheses yields 
%\begin{align}
%\omega=\frac{p(\mathbf{D}| \pi_{S})}{p(\mathbf{D}| \pi_{S})+p(\mathbf{D}| \pi_{E})}. 
%\end{align}
%The determination of a significant trial result is given by
%\begin{align*}
%P(\theta\in\Theta_1|\mathbf{D},\pi_I)\geq\delta.
%\end{align*} 

%All relevant information about $\theta$ can be derived from the marginal posterior distribution with an inference prior (e.g. posterior mean, credible intervals). For example, the posterior mean using the inference prior will be a two-part mixture of the posterior means using the skeptical and enthusiastic priors: $E(\theta|\mathbf{D},\pi_I)=\omega E(\theta|\mathbf{D}, \pi_{S})+(1-\omega) E(\theta|\mathbf{D}, \pi_{E}).$
\subsubsection{Incorporating Prior Information in the Monitoring Priors}
The skeptical and enthusiastic monitoring priors can be viewed as a weighted combination such as in the inference prior (\ref{eq:inference_prior}) with weights $\omega=1$ and $\omega=0$ respectively. This weighted combination can be used as a replacement for the monitoring prior for any fixed weight $\omega$. For example, a ``not-as-skeptical" prior can be defined as $\tilde{\pi_S}(\theta)=0.75\cdot\pi_S(\theta)+0.25\cdot\pi_E(\theta)$. 

Alternatively, $\omega$ can be informed by the data. Let $\hat{\theta}=argmax \{p(\mathbf{D}|\theta)\}$ be the maximum likelihood estimator of $\theta$ given the data. Define
\begin{align}
\omega=\frac{\pi_S(\hat{\theta})}{\pi_S(\hat{\theta})+\pi_E(\hat{\theta})}
\end{align}
as a mixing weight that dynamically gives preference to the prior that has the higher density evaluated at $\hat{\theta}$.
%\textcolor{green}{We don't have anything in the paper about using a mixture of the skeptical and enthusiastic prior to 
%define a ``less'' skeptical monitor prior that incorporates information from another source using the 
%notion of applicability (i.e., a fixed value of $\omega_0$ that is not 1.). 
%%
%This is fundamental to the novelty of the paper. 
%%
%I think it would be good to show how the GN can be used to inform a prior for the control group with flexibility here (e.g., flattening the prior over an interval)
%AND talking about the mixture skeptical monitoring prior.
%%
%In the case of using ``no prior information'' the enthusiastic prior is simply used for monitoring. But it can be incorporated directly into the 
%skeptical prior when it is informed by data using the concept of applicability.
%%
%Isn't that what was done for the second example? Lets talk if we need to. This is a big part of the novelty.

\section{Examples}

\subsection{Single-Arm Proof-of-Activity Trial with Binary Endpoint}
\subsubsection{Motivating example}
Consider the T72 pediatric trial ``A Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Infliximab (REMICADE) in Pediatric Patients With Moderately to Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis" (NCT00336492) ~\cite{Hyams2012}. Infliximab was given to all subjects at the 5mg/kg dose at weeks 0, 2, and 6, and the primary end point was response at week 8. Response was measured by improvement in disease severity scores.

The initial enrollment occurred on August 25, 2006, and the last assessment was June 24, 2010. If the patient showed improvement at week 8 then they continued treatment and would have their last assessment at week 54. The response rate at 8 weeks was $73.3\%$ $(N=60)$, so it is likely that the last assessment was at week 54, and we can infer enrollment took place over approximately 33.5 months (approximately 1 enrollment per 17 days). 

The sample size of $60$ patients was chosen to ensure $12\%$ precision in estimating the true response proportion with at $95\%$ CI, assuming a response rate of $67\%$ as was observed among adults from the ACT 1 and ACT 2 trials ~\cite{Rutgeerts2005} at the same 5mg/kg dose $(N=242)$. A $95\%$ confidence interval that excluded $0.40$ was determined to be a clinically significant result.

\subsubsection{Model formulation \& prior elicitation}
The data $\mathbf{D}$ are assumed to be independent Bernoulli random variables with common response probability $\theta$. The null response value is $\theta_0=0.40$ and a highly efficacious response probability is $\theta_1=0.67$. The hypothesis for this trial is $H_0:\leq \theta_0$ vs $H_1:\theta > \theta_0$.

The default skeptical and enthusiastic priors will be of the form (\ref{eq:generalizednormalkernel}) and are truncated to the unit interval. 
\begin{align}
\pi_S(\theta)&\propto \exp\left\{-\frac{|\theta-\theta_0|}{\sigma_S}^{\beta_S}\right\} I(\theta\in[0,1]) \label{eq:ex1skptprior}\\
\pi_E(\theta)&\propto \exp\left\{-\frac{|\theta-\theta_1|}{\sigma_E}^{\beta_E}\right\} I(\theta\in[0,1])\label{eq:ex1enthprior}
\end{align}

The values $\beta_S$ and $\beta_E$ are pre-specified and $\sigma_S$ and $\sigma_E$ are chosen to satisfy the tail-probability conditions 
(\ref{eq:enthprior})-(\ref{eq:skptprior}).

The skeptical prior is shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure1}(B), which has added concentration around the null response value $\theta_0$ by pre-specifying $\beta_S>2$. The enthusiastic prior is shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure1}(C) with a default choice of $\beta_E=2$. The level of residual uncertainty is given by $\epsilon=0.025$. The skeptical prior was chosen to have additional Type 1 error control. A comparison of the various combinations of the monitoring priors in Figure~\ref{fig:figure1} is provided in Appendix \ref{sec:priorRobustness}.

Enrollment will proceed until one of the following three conditions are satisfied:
\begin{align}
\text{Efficacy criteria (EFF): }&P(\theta>\theta_0|\mathbf{D},\pi_S)\geq 1-\epsilon \label{eq:ex1efficacy}\\
\text{Futility criteria (FUT): }&P\left(\theta\leq\frac{\theta_0+\theta_1}{2} \Big|\mathbf{D},\pi_E\right)\geq 1-\epsilon \label{eq:ex1futility}\\
\text{Maximum sample size: }&N=112 \text{ patient outcomes obtained}\label{eq:ex1maxss}
\end{align}

where the maximum sample size was chosen based on a frequentist design to have $80\%$ power at a true response proportion of $\frac{\theta_0+\theta_1}{2}=0.535$.

If enrollment is terminated due to the efficacy or futility criteria being satisfied, those subjects who are still undergoing follow-up will still have their outcomes considered in the final analysis.

\subsubsection{Example paths}
Violin plots are used to show the results of a simulated trials with the initial prior specification (first panel), three interim analyses (middle panels), and a final analysis (last panel), where interim analyses are conducted after every 10 completed outcomes. The first panel shows the skeptical and enthusiastic prior distributions from (\ref{eq:ex1skptprior}), (\ref{eq:ex1enthprior}), which are the same as introduced in Figure \ref{fig:figure1}(b) and (c). The other panels show the posterior distributions using the skeptical and enthusiastic priors respectively. An inference prior is defined as the mixture (\ref{eq:inference_prior}) with $\omega=0.5$, and its mean and $95\%$ credible intervals are shown.

Figure \ref{fig:figure2a} shows the results of a trial where at the third interim analysis the efficacy condition (\ref{eq:ex1efficacy}) is satisfied and enrollment is terminated. Note that in the final analysis the efficacy condition is no longer at the $1-\epsilon$ threshold. A discussion of this type of ``evidence decrease" is given in Section \ref{sec:ex1operatingcharacteristics}.

Figure \ref{fig:figure2b} shows the results of a trial where at the third interim analysis the futility condition (\ref{eq:ex1futility}) is satisfied and enrollment is terminated.

\subsubsection{Preposterior Analysis of Operating Characteristics}\label{sec:ex1operatingcharacteristics}
An interim analysis will be completed after every 2 subjects complete follow-up. The inference prior is defined as the mixture (\ref{eq:inference_prior}) with $\omega=0.5$ is used in evaluating the posterior mean and coverage probability.

Figure \ref{fig:ex1operatingcharacteristics} shows the operating characters of this particular trial design. Stopping early for efficacy refers to satisfying (\ref{eq:ex1efficacy}), stopping early for futility refers to satisfying (\ref{eq:ex1futility}), and inconclusive findings refers to (\ref{eq:ex1maxss}). 

When the true response probability is $\theta=\theta_0$, there is a $3.9\%$ probability of stopping the trial early for efficacy. The posterior mean shows a slight bias towards the alternative hypothesis.

Figure \ref{fig:ex1evidencedecrease} addresses the particular situation of when the efficacy criteria (\ref{eq:ex1efficacy}) is satisfied at an interim analysis triggering termination of enrollment of additional subjects, but once the outcomes of subjects undergoing follow-up are ascertained the criteria is no longer satisfied. The distribution of the efficacy criteria given the final data for these cases are shown. The probability of these cases occurring is reflected by the percent agreement between interim and final results, and it is shown that as $\theta$ increases there is a higher probability of agreement and therefore a lower probability of evidence decrease.

The median efficacy criteria is very close to $1-\epsilon$ and in the vast majority of cases (greater than 10th percentile) the efficacy criteria is still very high. Therefore, for this trial design, the interim and final results are not highly discrepant with respect to the efficacy criteria in these cases.

%\subsubsection*{Vemurafenib Trial }
%``In this study, a response rate of 15\% at week
%8 was considered to be low, a response rate of
%45\% was considered to be high, and a response
%rate of 35\% was considered to be low but still
%desirable and indicative of efficacy. Assuming
%response rates as specified in the hypothesis testing, a power of 80\% for a high response rate and
%70\% for the low but still desirable response rate,
%and a two-sided alpha level of 0.1, we calculated
%that the number of patients required in each
%cohort would be 7, 13, or 19, depending on the
%results obtained."

\subsubsection{Type 1 error rate by the frequency of data monitoring}
Figure \ref{fig:ex1t1e} shows the probability of the efficacy criteria (\ref{eq:ex1efficacy}) being satisfied at an interim or final analysis when $\theta=\theta_0$. The monitoring frequency is 1 when an interim analysis is made after every completed outcome (i.e. fully sequential), and is 112 (the maximum sample size) if the only analysis is done at the maximum sample size. 

The probability of the efficacy criteria being (errantly) satisfied is the highest for a fully sequential design, and decreases as the monitoring frequency decreases. However, the probability of the efficacy criteria being satisfied with the final data is very low for any type of sequential monitoring (under 0.02 in all cases).
\begin{figure}
  \begin{subfigure}{6in}
    \centering\includegraphics[width=6in]{P:/Bayesian-Sequential-Monitoring/00-paper/FIGURES/figure4.png}

\end{figure}

%Even at the extreme case where an interim analysis is conducted after every outcome, the probability of stopping at the interim due to a promising result when the true response is at the null level is only $0.108$ (about double the nominal rate), and even in this situation the Type 1 error rate once follow-up is complete does not exceed $0.05$. Thus Bayesian sequential monitoring has good frequentist properties even with frequent interim analyses.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The two sides of the discussion: first is what happens during the trial regarding sequential monitoring, such as \% of time stopping early vs. trial done to completion and expected sample size. Second is the final determination of efficacy or futility and how that relates to Type 1 Error and power. 
%\item  Remember the best case for sequential monitoring is slow enrollment relative to outcome ascertainment. Slow enrollment means there is a benefit to ending trial early and reach a conclusion faster. Outcome ascertainment needs to be somewhat fast to ensure a good \# of outcomes are generated.
%\end{itemize}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Want to highlight that the ultimate inference will have no Type 1 error inflation. At this point the ultimate inference for efficacy is still made with skeptical prior.
%\item Label lines nicely.
%\item ``Only bad thing to do is to stop learning"
%\item Enrollment rate and \% of ongoing data as operating characteristics are interesting ideas, but focus on the plots already created.
%\item Mat: Scaling on \# of subjects in each interim analysis rather than \# of interim analyses (e.g. flip X axis). Make labels go vertical or diagonal.
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parallel Two-Group Design with Binary Endpoint}
\subsubsection{Motivating example}
Consider the trial ``The Pediatric Lupus Trial of Belimumab Plus Background Standard Therapy (PLUTO)" (NCT01649765). Subjects were randomized to Belimumab 10mg/kg or placebo, and the primary endpoint was response at week 52. Response was measured by improvement in disease severity scores. The goal was to test for superiority of Belimumab to placebo. 

The study start date was September 7, 2012, and the primary completion date was January 24, 2018. Since the follow-up period is 52 weeks the last enrollment is estimated to be a year prior to the primary competition date yielding an average enrollment rate of one enrollment per $17.2$ days.

The study design included enrollment of 100 subjects, the first 24 subjects randomized in a 5:1 ratio (Belimumab:placebo) and the remaining 76 subjects would be randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio. Therefore, 58 subjects would be randomized to Belimumab and 42 to placebo. The sample size was based on feasibility constraints rather than a power calculation, and the study was terminated after 93 subjects enrolled.

\subsubsection{Model formulation \& prior elicitation}
The data $\mathbf{D}$ are assumed to be independent Bernoulli random variables with response probability $\theta_0$ for the placebo group and $\theta_1$ for the treatment (IP for investigational product) group. The null response value for the difference $\delta=\theta_1-\theta_0=0$ is  and a highly efficacious response probability is $\delta=\theta_1-\theta_0=0.12$. Consider the hypothesis testing of IP superiority to control $H_0:\theta_1-\theta_0\leq 0\text{ vs. }H_1: \theta_1-\theta_0>0$. An estimate for the treatment probability from adult trials is $\theta_1=0.51$.

The priors will be chosen based on the generalized normal distribution (\ref{eq:generalizednormalkernel}) based on the joint specification in (\ref{eq:generalized_normal_joint}) and truncated to the unit square 

The skeptical and enthusiastic priors will have the same component for
\begin{align}
\pi(\theta_0)\propto \exp\left\{-\left(\frac{|\theta_0-\mu|}{\sigma}\right)^{\beta}\right\}\times I(\theta_0 \in [0,1])
\end{align}
The location parameter is chosen to be $\mu=\theta_1-\delta_E=0.39$. The shape and scale parameters $\sigma$ and $\beta$ are chosen so that the prior is flat in the region $\mu\pm 0.10$ and is shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure5}(E). 

The skeptical and enthusiastic priors are differentiated by their parameterizations for 
\begin{align}
\pi_S(\theta_1|\theta_0)\propto&\exp\left\{-\left(\frac{|\theta_1-\theta_0-\delta_0|}{\sigma_S}\right)^{\beta_S}\right\}\times f_S(\theta_0) \times I((\theta_0,\theta_1)\in [0,1]\times[0,1])\\
\pi_E(\theta_1|\theta_0)\propto&\exp\left\{-\left(\frac{|\theta_1-\theta_0-\delta_1|}{\sigma_E}\right)^{\beta_E}\right\}\times f_E(\theta_0) \times I((\theta_0,\theta_1)\in [0,1]\times[0,1])
\end{align}

The values $\beta_S$ and $\beta_E$ are pre-specified and $\sigma_S$ and $\sigma_E$ are chosen to satisfy the tail-probability conditions 
(\ref{eq:ex2enthcondition})-(\ref{eq:ex2skptcondition}).

The complete skeptical and enthusiastic priors are then given by 
\begin{align}
\pi_S(\theta_0,\theta_1)\propto&\exp\left\{-\left(\frac{|\theta_0-\mu|}{\sigma}\right)^{\beta}\right\}\times \exp\left\{-\left(\frac{|\theta_1-\theta_0-\delta_0|}{\sigma_S}\right)^{\beta_S}\right\}\times I((\theta_0,\theta_1)\in [0,1]\times[0,1])\label{eq:ex2skpt}\\
\pi_E(\theta_0,\theta_1)\propto&\exp\left\{-\left(\frac{|\theta_0-\mu|}{\sigma}\right)^{\beta}\right\}\times \exp\left\{-\left(\frac{|\theta_1-\theta_0-\delta_1|}{\sigma_E}\right)^{\beta_E}\right\}\times I((\theta_0,\theta_1)\in [0,1]\times[0,1])\label{eq:ex2enth}.
\end{align}

The joint priors $\pi_S(\theta_0,\theta_1)$ $\pi_E(\theta_0,\theta_1$ as well as the marginal priors $\pi_S(\theta_1-\theta_0)$, $\pi_E(\theta_1-\theta_0)$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:figure5}.
%
%where $c_S$ and $c_E$ are normalizing constants. The values of $\sigma_S$ and $\sigma_{S1}$ are chosen such that $P(\theta_1-\theta_0>0.1|\pi_S)=0.05$. Similarly, $\sigma_E$ and $\sigma_{E1}$ are chosen such that $P(\theta_1-\theta_0\leq0|\pi_E)=0.05$.

%\begin{align*}
%\pi(\theta_0,\theta_1)\propto& \hspace{0.05in}exp \left\{-\frac{1}{2}\left|\frac{(\theta_1-\theta_0)-\delta}{\sigma}\right|^\sigma\right\}
%\end{align*}


%Here we wish to elicit pessimistic and enthusiastic priors consistent with the following:
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item The control group response probability is expected to be approximately $0.20$ and investigators are relatively sure
%		    that the it will be between 0.5 and 0.35.
%				
%	\item The IP group response probability is likely to provide an improvement of approximately 0.20.
%\end{enumerate}

Enrollment will proceed until one of the following three conditions are satisfied:
\begin{align}
\text{Efficacy criteria (EFF): }&P(\theta_1-\theta_0>\delta_0|\mathbf{D},\pi_S)\geq 1-\epsilon\\
\text{Futility criteria (FUT): }&P\left(\theta_1-\theta_0 \leq \frac{\delta_0+\delta_1}{2}\Big|\mathbf{D},\pi_E\right)\geq 1-\epsilon\\
\text{Maximum sample size: }&N=100 \text{ patient outcomes}
\end{align}

An interim analysis is competed after every 10 subjects have completed outcomes.

\subsubsection{Design properties: Results}

Simulations were run fixing the placebo response rate at $\theta_0=0.39$ and varying the treatment response rate $\theta_1\in[0.39,0.51]$. Due to the low maximum sample size, no simulations resulted in the efficacy criteria $(P(\theta_1-\theta_0>0|\mathbf{D},\pi_S)\geq 0.975)$ being satisfied. Instead of the skeptical prior $\pi_S$ being used for the efficacy criteria, an inference prior $\pi_I$ of the form (\ref{eq:inference_prior}) is used where the choice of $\omega$ in (\ref{eq:omega_formula}) is determined based on varying $p(\pi_S)$ and $p(\pi_E)$ at the outset.
