\begin{itemize}

       and $\boldsymbol\psi$ is a nuisance parameter (possible vector valued).

 \item I would have a generic graphic to illustrate the types of priors and the mixture.
 %\item Motivate in the context of a simple example (i.e., single parameter binary example).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Bayesian hypothesis testing based on posterior probabilities}

The Bayesian framework allows direct inference on a parameter of interest through specification of a model for the data generating mechanism and prior distributions for unknown quantities. Let $\mathbf{D}$ be a random variable representing the data collected in the trial with density $p(\mathbf{D}|\theta,\psi)$ where $\theta$ and $\psi$ are the unknown quantities. Let $\theta$ be the parameter of interest and $\psi$ be the unknown quantities that are not of research interest (i.e. ``nuisance parameters"). Define the sample spaces for the unknown quantities as $\theta\in\Theta$ and $\psi\in\Psi$. Suppose the hypotheses under consideration are $H_0:\theta\in\Theta_{H_0}$ versus $H_1:\theta\in\Theta_{H_1}$, where $\Theta=\Theta_{H_0}\cup \Theta_{H_1}$ and $\Theta_{H_0}\cap \Theta_{H_1}=\emptyset$. These hypotheses are adjudicated based on posterior probabilities of $\theta$ by evaluating $P(\theta\in\Theta_{H_i}|\mathbf{D})=\int_{\Theta_{H_i}}p(\theta|\mathbf{D})d\theta$ for $i\in\{0,1\}$, where $p(\theta|\mathbf{D})=\int_{\Psi}p(\theta,\psi|\mathbf{D})d\psi$. The posterior distribution of $\theta$ depends on the choice of prior distribution $\pi(\theta,\psi)$, since $p(\theta,\psi|\mathbf{D})=p(\mathbf{D}|\theta,\psi)\pi(\theta,\psi)/p(\mathbf{D})$ by Bayes rule. The specification of the prior distribution depends on the research objective. An \textit{inference prior} is a prior that is used when the research objective is to make final analysis after data collection is complete. A \textit{monitoring prior} is a prior that is used when the research objective is monitor enrollment with an eye towards early termination.
%Possible simplifying functional relationships between $\theta$ and $\psi$ are conditional independence $\pi(\theta,\psi)=\pi(\theta|\psi)\pi(\psi)$ and independence $\pi(\theta,\psi)=\pi(\theta)\pi(\psi)$. An inference prior is often non-informative or objective in the sense that it does not show preference to $H_0$ or $H_1$. Decisions made using using a non-informative prior are often similar to those made in the frequentist setting. 

It has been said that `the purpose of a trial is to collect data that bring to conclusive consensus at termination opinions that had been diverse and indecisive at the outset' (Kass and Greenhouse (1989)). These opinions manifest as priors $\pi(\theta,\psi)$ for which their relation to $P(\theta\in\Theta_i|\pi(\theta,\psi))$ $i\in\{0,1\}$ is examined (note this quantity does not depend on the data $\mathbf{D}$ and therefore reflect a-priori opinion). An inference prior is often non-informative or objective in the sense that it does not show preference to $H_0$ or $H_1$. This prior $\pi_{I}(\theta,\psi)\equiv\pi_{I}$ has the property that $P(\theta\in\Theta_0|\pi_I)\approx P(\theta\in\Theta_1|\pi_I)$. A skeptical prior is an informative or subjective prior that gives preference to $H_0$. This prior $\pi_{S}(\theta,\psi)\equiv\pi_{S}$ has the property that $P(\theta\in\Theta_0| \pi_{S})>1-\epsilon_S$ (equivalently $P(\theta\in\Theta_1| \pi_{S})<\epsilon_S$) for some $\epsilon_S>0$ whereby $1-\epsilon_S$ signifies a high level of certainty. For example, if $\epsilon_S=0.05$, then this choice of skeptical prior places 95\% prior probability that $\theta\in\Theta_0$. An enthuastic prior $\pi_{E}(\theta,\psi)\equiv\pi_{E}$ similarly gives preference to $H_1$ through the property that $P(\theta\in\Theta_1| \pi_{E})>1-\epsilon_E$ (equivalently $P(\theta\in\Theta_0| \pi_{E})<\epsilon_E$) for some $\epsilon_E>0$.

Early termination of the trial is only appriopriate if diverse prior opinions about $\theta$ would be in agreement given the interm data. It is then reasonable to stop data collection when a sufficiently \textit{skeptical person} is convinced that $H_1$ is true or a sufficiently \textit{enthuastic person} is convinced that $H_1$ is false. The use of monitoring based on changing the opinion of skeptical and enthuastic priors has been described as overcoming a handicap (\cite{Freedman1989}) and providing a brake (\cite{Fayers1997}) on the premature termination of trials, or constructing ``an adversary who will need to be disilusioned by the data to stop further experimentation" (\cite{Spiegelhalter1994}). Let $\delta>0$ be chosen such that $1-\delta$ is a threshold for ``convinced" that will be used for the posterior probability of $\theta$ at an interm analysis. It is reasonable to stop the trial for efficacy if, once presented with the data, the skeptical viewpoint as updated via Bayes rule becomes convinced of the alternative hypothesis, that is, if $P(\theta\in\Theta_1|\mathbf{D}, \pi_{S})>1-\delta_S$. For example, if $\delta_S=0.1$, then the trial can be stopped if the skeptical viewpoint now places 90\% posterior probability in the region of treatment efficacy. Similarly, it is reasponable to stop the trial for futility if $P(\theta\in\Theta_0|\mathbf{D}, \pi_{E})>1-\delta_E$.

%Summarizing~\cite{Spiegelhalter1993} and others:  or that the benefit of treatment is not likely to be what was expected, the probability of \textit{eventually} proving that $H_1$ is true is sufficiently low, or the resources have been exhausted.  
%A standard Bayesian decision rule would reject $H_0$ when $P(\theta\in\Theta_{H_1}|D\geq 0.95)$ which will result in a Type I error rate of $0.05$ when the analysis prior is non-informative (a so-called reference or flat prior). The Bayes factor in favor of $H_0$ is defined as 
%\begin{align*}
%BF=\frac{p(D|H_0)}{p(D|H_1)}=\frac{\int_{\Theta_{H_0}}p(D|\theta,H_0)\pi(\theta|H_0)d\theta}{\int_{\Theta_{H_1}}p(D|\theta,H_0)\pi(\theta|H_1)d\theta}
%\end{align*}
%and let $p(\theta|D,\pi)$ denote the posterior distribution of $\theta$ given a particular prior distribution.


Final inference on $\theta$ is made once enrollment is stopped based on the monitoring priors or at the planned end of the trial. We propose use of a mixture prior constructed from the monitoring process as the inference prior. Define $p(\mathbf{D}|\pi)=\int L (\theta|\mathbf{D})\pi(\theta)d\theta$ to be the marginal likelihood for the data given the prior $\pi$. One can average the posterior means from the analyses using the skeptical and enthuastic priors, such that,
\begin{align*}
E(\theta|\mathbf{D},\pi_{Inference})=\omega\times E(\theta|\mathbf{D}, \pi_{S})+(1-\omega)\times E(\theta|\mathbf{D}, \pi_{E})
\end{align*}
for $\omega\in[0,1]$. Choosing $\omega=1/2$ corresponds to an agnostic inference prior. Choosing $\omega$ based on posterior model probabilities of the null and alternative hypothesis yields $\omega=p(\mathbf{D}| \pi_{S}/(p(\mathbf{D}| \pi_{S})+p(\mathbf{D}| \pi_{E}))$.
%\begin{align*}
%\pi_{Inference}=\frac{p(\mathbf{D}| \pi_{S}) \pi_{S}+p(\mathbf{D}| \pi_{E}) \pi_{E}}{p(\mathbf{D}| \pi_{S})+p(\mathbf{D}| \pi_{E})}
%\end{align*}
%\begin{align*}
%E(\theta|\mathbf{D},\pi_{Inference})=\omega\times E(\theta|\mathbf{D}, \pi_{S})+(1-\omega)\times E(\theta|\mathbf{D}, \pi_{E})
%\end{align*}
%Need to describe relation to Type I and Type II error.
\subsubsection{Default parameterization of monitoring priors for common designs}\label{monitoring_prior_specification}
Define prior distribution as $\pi(\theta|\lambda)$ where $\lambda$ is a vector of hyperparameters.

Skeptical prior might be centered around the clinical inferiority boundary.
Enthuastic prior might be centered around clinical superiority boundry.
Variance based on tail area considerations, or by matching the skeptical prior variance.

Reference prior attempts to express no particular opinion about the treatment's merit. 



\subsection{Futility Monitoring Using Probability of Success (EVAN -- draft on 6/21)}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Futility monitoring using POS is about stopping early when their is a high likelihood
       of a study being inconclusive at the end of the study.
 \item Since the final analysis uses the \textit{Inference} prior, POS should be based on the
       inference prior.
 \item Develop the framework for POS and show how it is a weighted average POS based on the skeptical
       and enthusiastic priors.
\end{itemize}
As an alternative strategy to futility analysis, one can monitor the probability of success (POS) for the trial. The probability of getting a convincing result at the end of the trail can be computed using the interm data. Let $p(\theta|D, \pi_{I})$ denote the posterior distribution for $\theta$ based on the inference prior $ \pi_{I}$ and the current data $D$. Let $\omega$ denote the POS which is given as follows:
\begin{align*}
\omega=E[1\{P(\theta\in\Theta_1|D_1,D, \pi_{S})\geq 1-\delta\}]
\end{align*}
where the expectation is taken with respect to the posterior predictive distribution $p(D_1)$ for future data $D_1$ (ongoing + subjects yet to enroll):
\begin{align*}
p(D_1)=\int p(D_1|\theta)\times \pi(\theta|D)d\theta.
\end{align*}
One may stop the enrollment if $\omega$ is sufficiently small (i.e., $\omega<0.05$).

Stochastic curtailment in frequentist setting.
\section{Examples -- (EVAN)}

\subsection{Single-Arm Oncology Proof-of-Activity Trial w/ Binary Endpoint}
For example, consider testing the hypothesis $H_0:\theta\leq\theta_0$ versus $H_1:\theta>\theta_0$ where $\theta$ is a treatment effect of interest. Suppose an effect $\theta_1>\theta_0$ is thought to be highly clinically relevant and plausible given what limited data is available. Consider a clinical trial with a single analysis and fixed sample size chosen that there is a high probability of proving $H_1$ when $\theta=\theta_1$. A standard Bayesian decision rule would reject $H_0$ when $P(\theta>\theta_0|D)\geq 0.95$ which will result in a type one error rate of $0.05$ (approximately) if $\theta=\theta_0$ when the analysis prior is non-informative (a so-called reference or flat prior).
\subsection{Parallel Two-Group Superiority Trial /w Continuous Binary Endpoint}

\subsection{Three-Arm, Placebo Controlled Non-Inferiority Trial w/ Continuous Endpoint}

\section{Discussion -- (MATT/EVAN)}

%\section{Example of Parallel Two-Group Design}
%
%In this section we consider a sequential monitoring approach in a parallel two-group setting using a binary response endpoint.
%
%We consider the case where the goal is prove superiority of an investigational product (IP) to a control 
%which could be a placebo.
%
%Let $\pi_0$ represent the response rate the control group and $\pi_1$ represent the response probability for the IP group.
%
%Here we wish to elicit pessimistic and enthusiastic priors consistent with the following:
% \begin{enumerate}
%  \item The control group response probability is expected to be approximately $0.20$ and investigators are relatively sure
%		    that the it will be between 0.5 and 0.35.
%				
%	\item The IP group response probability is likely to provide an improvement of approximately 0.20.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%In this setting pessimism or optimism is reflected in the induced prior on the difference in proportions $\pi_1 - \pi_0$.
%
%One easy way to specify such a prior in this case is to elicit a bivariate normal prior for $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$ truncated to the unit square.
