abstract = {BACKGROUND: BRAF V600 mutations occur in various nonmelanoma cancers. We undertook a histology-independent phase 2 "basket" study of vemurafenib in BRAF V600 mutation-positive nonmelanoma cancers. METHODS: We enrolled patients in six prespecified cancer cohorts; patients with all other tumor types were enrolled in a seventh cohort. A total of 122 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive cancer were treated, including 27 patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. The primary end point was the response rate; secondary end points included progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS: In the cohort with non-small-cell lung cancer, the response rate was 42{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 20 to 67) and median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95{\%} CI, 3.5 to 10.8). In the cohort with Erdheim-Chester disease or Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis, the response rate was 43{\%} (95{\%} CI, 18 to 71); the median treatment duration was 5.9 months (range, 0.6 to 18.6), and no patients had disease progression during therapy. There were anecdotal responses among patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, salivary-duct cancer, ovarian cancer, and clear-cell sarcoma and among patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. Safety was similar to that in prior studies of vemurafenib for melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: BRAF V600 appears to be a targetable oncogene in some, but not all, nonmelanoma cancers. Preliminary vemurafenib activity was observed in non-small-cell lung cancer and in Erdheim-Chester disease and Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis. The histologic context is an important determinant of response in BRAF V600-mutated cancers. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01524978.).},

@article{Zalevsky2007,
abstract = {TNF is a pleiotropic cytokine required for normal development and function of the immune system; however, TNF overexpression also induces inflammation and is associated with autoimmune diseases. TNF exists as both a soluble and a transmembrane protein. Genetic studies in mice have suggested that inflammation in disease models involves soluble TNF (solTNF) and that maintenance of innate immune function involves transmembrane TNF (tmTNF). These findings imply that selective pharmacologic inhibition of solTNF may be anti-inflammatory and yet preserve innate immunity to infection. To address this hypothesis, we now describe dominant-negative inhibitors of TNF (DN-TNFs) as a new class of biologics that selectively inhibits solTNF. DN-TNFs blocked solTNF activity in human and mouse cells, a human blood cytokine release assay, and two mouse arthritis models. In contrast, DN-TNFs neither inhibited the activity of human or mouse tmTNF nor suppressed innate immunity to Listeria infection in mice. These results establish DN-TNFs as the first selective inhibitors of solTNF, demonstrate that inflammation in mouse arthritis models is primarily driven by solTNF, and suggest that the maintenance of tmTNF activity may improve the therapeutic index of future anti-inflammatory agents.},

@article{Berry2013,
abstract = {BackgroundIn oncology, the treatment paradigm is shifting toward personalized medicine, where the goal is to match patients to the treatments most likely to deliver benefit. Treatment effects in various subpopulations may provide some information about treatment effects in other subpopulations.PurposeWe compare different approaches to Phase II trial design where a new treatment is being investigated in several groups of patients. We compare considering each group in an independent trial to a single trial with hierarchical modeling of the patient groups.MethodsWe assume four patient groups with different background response rates and simulate operating characteristics of three trial designs, Simon?s Optimal Two-Stage design, a Bayesian adaptive design with frequent interim analyses, and a Bayesian adaptive design with frequent interim analyses and hierarchical modeling across patient groups.ResultsSimon?s designs are based on 10{\%} Type I and Type II error rates. The independent Bayesian designs are tuned to have similar error rates, but may have a slightly smaller mean sample size due to more frequent interim analyses. Under the null, the mean sample size is 2?4 patients smaller. A hierarchical model across patient groups can provide additional power and a further reduction in mean sample size. Under the null, the addition of the hierarchical model decreases the mean sample size an additional 4?7 patients in each group. Under the alternative hypothesis, power is increased to at least 98{\%} in all groups.LimitationsHierarchical borrowing can make finding a single group in which the treatment is promising, if there is only one, more difficult. In a scenario where the treatment is uninteresting in all but one group, power for that one group is reduced to 65{\%}. When the drug appears promising in some groups and not in others, there is potential for borrowing to inflate the Type I error rate.ConclusionsThe Bayesian hierarchical design is more likely to correctly conclude efficacy or futility than the other two designs in many scenarios. The Bayesian hierarchical design is a strong design for addressing possibly differential effects in different groups.},

@article{Chen2003,
abstract = {We propose a novel class of conjugate priors for the family of generalized linear models. Properties of the priors are investigated in detail and elicitation issues are examined. We establish theorems characterizing the propriety and existence of moments of the priors under various settings, examine asymptotic properties of the priors, and investigate the relationship to normal priors. Our approach is based on the notion of specifying a prior prediction y0 for the response vector of the current study, and a scalar precision parameter a0 which quantifies one's prior belief in y0. Then (y0,a0), along with the covariate matrix X of the current study, are used to specify the conjugate prior for the regression coefficients {\&}{\#}x3b2; in a generalized linear model. We examine properties of the prior for a0 fixed and for a0 random, and study elicitation strategies for (y0, a0) in detail. We also study generalized linear models with an unknown dispersion parameter. An example is given to demonstrate the properties of the prior and the resulting posterior.},

@article{Psioda2018,
abstract = {We consider the problem of Bayesian sample size determination for a clinical trial in the presence of historical data that inform the treatment effect. Our broadly applicable, simulation-based methodology provides a framework for calibrating the informativeness of a prior while simultaneously identifying the minimum sample size required for a new trial such that the overall design has appropriate power to detect a non-null treatment effect and reasonable type I error control. We develop a comprehensive strategy for eliciting null and alternative sampling prior distributions which are used to define Bayesian generalizations of the traditional notions of type I error control and power. Bayesian type I error control requires that a weighted-average type I error rate not exceed a prespecified threshold. We develop a procedure for generating an appropriately sized Bayesian hypothesis test using a simple partial-borrowing power prior which summarizes the fraction of information borrowed from the historical trial. We present results from simulation studies that demonstrate that a hypothesis test procedure based on this simple power prior is as efficient as those based on more complicated meta-analytic priors, such as normalized power priors or robust mixture priors, when all are held to precise type I error control requirements. We demonstrate our methodology using a real data set to design a follow-up clinical trial with time-to-event endpoint for an investigational treatment in high-risk melanoma.},
