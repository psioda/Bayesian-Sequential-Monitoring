   abstract = {This paper describes a Bayesian approach to the design and analysis of clinical trials, and compares it with the frequentist approach. Both approaches address learning under uncertainty. But they are different in a variety of ways. The Bayesian approach is more flexible. For example, accumulating data from a clinical trial can be used to update Bayesian measures, independent of the design of the trial. Frequentist measures are tied to the design, and interim analyses must be planned for frequentist measures to have meaning. Its flexibility makes the Bayesian approach ideal for analysing data from clinical trials. In carrying out a Bayesian analysis for inferring treatment effect, information from the clinical trial and other sources can be combined and used explicitly in drawing conclusions. Bayesians and frequentists address making decisions very differently. For example, when choosing or modifying the design of a clinical trial, Bayesians use all available information, including that which comes from the trial itself. The ability to calculate predictive probabilities for future observations is a distinct advantage of the Bayesian approach to designing clinical trials and other decisions. An important difference between Bayesian and frequentist thinking is the role of randomization.},

   abstract = {The greatest virtue of traditional frequentist statistical approaches may be the extreme rigour and narrowness of focus, but a side effect of this virtue is inflexibility, which in turn limits innovation in the design and analysis of clinical trials.Because of this, clinical trials tend to be overly large, which increases the cost of developing new therapeutic approaches, and some patients are unnecessarily exposed to inferior experimental therapies. Bayesian approaches have the potential to address these issues.The defining characteristic of any statistical approach is how it deals with uncertainty. Unlike the frequentist approach, in the Bayesian approach, all uncertainty is measured by probability.The continuous learning that is possible in the Bayesian approach enables investigators to modify trials in midcourse. Modifications include stopping the trial, adaptively assigning patients to therapies that are performing better or that will give more information about the scientific question of interest, and adding and dropping treatment arms.In analysing the results of a clinical trial, the Bayesian attitude is to bring all available information to bear on the scientific question being addressed. Outside of a Bayesian perspective, such potentially important information is usually overlooked because the methodology used cannot incorporate it.The Bayesian approach has several advantages in drug development, such as the process of updating knowledge gradually rather than restricting to large discrete steps measured in trials or phases. Another advantage is that it is specifically tied to decision making, within a particular trial, within a drug development programme, and within establishing a company's portfolio of drugs under development.Therapeutic areas in which the clinical endpoints are observed early stand to benefit most from an increase in the use of Bayesian approaches. Similiarly, diseases such as cancer in which there is a burgeoning number of biomarkers available for assessing the disease's progress will also benefit.},

   abstract = {BackgroundIn oncology, the treatment paradigm is shifting toward personalized medicine, where the goal is to match patients to the treatments most likely to deliver benefit. Treatment effects in various subpopulations may provide some information about treatment effects in other subpopulations.PurposeWe compare different approaches to Phase II trial design where a new treatment is being investigated in several groups of patients. We compare considering each group in an independent trial to a single trial with hierarchical modeling of the patient groups.MethodsWe assume four patient groups with different background response rates and simulate operating characteristics of three trial designs, Simon?s Optimal Two-Stage design, a Bayesian adaptive design with frequent interim analyses, and a Bayesian adaptive design with frequent interim analyses and hierarchical modeling across patient groups.ResultsSimon?s designs are based on 10 \% Type I and Type II error rates. The independent Bayesian designs are tuned to have similar error rates, but may have a slightly smaller mean sample size due to more frequent interim analyses. Under the null, the mean sample size is 2?4 patients smaller. A hierarchical model across patient groups can provide additional power and a further reduction in mean sample size. Under the null, the addition of the hierarchical model decreases the mean sample size an additional 4?7 patients in each group. Under the alternative hypothesis, power is increased to at least 98 \% in all groups.LimitationsHierarchical borrowing can make finding a single group in which the treatment is promising, if there is only one, more difficult. In a scenario where the treatment is uninteresting in all but one group, power for that one group is reduced to 65 \% . When the drug appears promising in some groups and not in others, there is potential for borrowing to inflate the Type I error rate.ConclusionsThe Bayesian hierarchical design is more likely to correctly conclude efficacy or futility than the other two designs in many scenarios. The Bayesian hierarchical design is a strong design for addressing possibly differential effects in different groups.},

However, most previous Bayesian approaches have based the stopping decision on the posterior probability content of one or more regions of the parameter space, thus implicitly determining a loss and decision structure. In this paper, we offer a fully Bayesian approach to this problem, specifying not only the likelihood and prior distributions but appropriate loss functions as well. At each data monitoring point, we enumerate the available decisions and investigate the use of backward induction, implemented via Monte Carlo methods, to choose the optimal course of action. We then present a forward sampling algorithm that substantially eases the analytic and computational burdens associated with backward induction, offering the possibility of fully Bayesian optimal sequential monitoring for previously untenable numbers of interim looks. We show that forward sampling can always identify the optimal sequential strategy in the case of a one-parameter exponential family with a conjugate prior and monotone loss functions as well as the best member of a certain class of strategies when backward induction is infeasible. Finally, we illustrate and compare the forward and backward approaches using data from a recent AIDS clinical trial.},

Our approach is based on the notion of specifying a prior prediction y0 for the response vector of the current study, and a scalar precision parameter a0 which quantifies one's prior belief in y0. Then (y0,a0), along with the covariate matrix X of the current study, are used to specify the conjugate prior for the regression coefficients \& \# x3b2; in a generalized linear model. We examine properties of the prior for a0 fixed and for a0 random, and study elicitation strategies for (y0, a0) in detail.

   abstract = {Bayesian statistics, a currently controversial viewpoint concerning statistical inference, is based on a definition of probability as a particular measure of the opinions of ideally consistent people. Statistical inference is modification of these opinions in the light of evidence, and Bayes' theorem specifies how such modifications should be made. The tools of Bayesian statistics include the theory of specific distributions and the principle of stable estimation, which specifies when actual prior opinions may be satisfactorily approximated by a uniform distribution. A common feature of many classical significance tests is that a sharp null hypothesis is compared with a diffuse alternative hypothesis. Often evidence which, for a Bayesian statistician, strikingly supports the null hypothesis leads to rejection of that hypothesis by standard classical procedures. The likelihood principle emphasized in Bayesian statistics implies, among other things, that the rules governing when data collection stops are irrelevant to data interpretation. It is entirely appropriate to collect data until a point has been proven or disproven, or until the data collector runs out of time, money, or patience. (71 ref.)

Methods Patients (6–17 years old) who had active UC (Mayo scores of 6–12; endoscopic subscores ≥2) and had not responded to or tolerated conventional treatment were given 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6. The primary end point was response at week 8 (decreases in Mayo scores ≥30% and ≥3 points and decreases in rectal bleeding subscores of ≥1 or an absolute subscore of ≤1). At week 8, only responders were randomly assigned to groups given infliximab every 8 or 12 weeks (q8w or q12w) and followed through week 54. Maintenance end points included pediatric UC activity index scores 40%). Among responders, twice as many were in remission at week 54 after q8w (8 of 21, 38.1%) than q12w (4 of 22, 18.2%; P = .146) therapy. Assuming the q8w remission rate for responders, the overall remission rate at week 54 would be 28.6%. Serious adverse events and infusion reactions occurred in similar proportions in the q8w and q12w groups. No deaths, malignancies, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, or delayed hypersensitivity reactions were reported. Conclusions Infliximab was safe and effective, inducing a response at week 8 in 73.3% of pediatric patients with moderate to severely active UC who did not respond to conventional therapy. The overall remission rate at week 54 for all enrolled patients was 28.6%, assuming the more effective q8w remission rate.},

   abstract = {Abstract In long-term clinical trials, interim analyses are planned to reduce the number of patients needed. To meet this issue in a practical way, group sequential designs are used. Most of these trials are conducted with the objective of demonstrating differences in efficacy of treatments, for example, to show superiority of a new drug or experimental treatment to a control. However, an increasing number of trials are designed to establish equivalence in efficacy or bioequivalence. This paper deals with group sequential test procedures in two-sided equivalence trials. Optimized designs with respect to sample size behaviour are constructed. Tables containing optimal testing times and corresponding optimal critical values or values to construct an underlying α-spending function, respectively, are provided. An example illustrates their use when planning interim analyses in equivalence trials. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {[A multiple testing procedure is proposed for comparing two treatments when response to treatment is both dichotomous (i.e., success or failure) and immediate. The proposed test statistic for each test is the usual (Pearson) chi-square statistic based on all data collected to that point. The maximum number (N) of tests and the number (m1 + m2) of observations collected between successive tests is fixed in advance. The overall size of the procedure is shown to be controlled with virtually the same accuracy as the single sample chi-square test based on N(m1 + m2) observations. The power is also found to be virtually the same. However, by affording the opportunity to terminate early when one treatment performs markedly better than the other, the multiple testing procedure may eliminate the ethical dilemmas that often accompany clinical trials.]},

   abstract = {The accumulating data from all randomized trials conducted by the Cancer Therapy Committee (CTC) of the British Medical Research Council are monitored on a regular basis. However, for important practical reasons the form of this data monitoring may vary from trial to trial. Thus a trial addressing what is considered a major question in the treatment of cancer patients, (a 'pivotal' or 'high profile' trial), has a formal data monitoring committee (DMC). This is usually made up of two clinicians and one statistician who are completely independent of the trial organization and do not enter patients into the trial. Other trials, which constitute the majority, are monitored by a less formal trial progress group made up of the clinical co-ordinator and trial statistician, sometimes supplemented by a trial participant. Experience with this dual system has led to a new proposal: if the trial progress group wish to modify or stop a trial then they are required to set up and consult an ad hoc DMC for independent advice. This proposal has many advantages, including maximizing the use of resources available, while achieving the degree of objectivity in decision-making required for the many different types of cancer trials conducted by the CTC.},

   abstract = {[In clinical trials with sequential patient entry, fixed sample size designs are unjustified on ethical grounds and sequential designs are often impracticable. One solution is a group sequential design dividing patient entry into a number of equal-sized groups so that the decision to stop the trial or continue is based on repeated significance tests of the accumulated data after each group is evaluated. Exact results are obtained for a trial with two treatments and a normal response with known variance. The design problem of determining the required size and number of groups is also considered. Simulation shows that these normal results may be adapted to other types of response data. An example shows that group sequential designs can sometimes be statistically superior to standard sequential designs.]},

   journal = {Biostatistics},
   pages = {kxy009-kxy009},
   abstract = {We consider the problem of Bayesian sample size determination for a clinical trial in the presence of historical data that inform the treatment effect. Our broadly applicable, simulation-based methodology provides a framework for calibrating the informativeness of a prior while simultaneously identifying the minimum sample size required for a new trial such that the overall design has appropriate power to detect a non-null treatment effect and reasonable type I error control. We develop a comprehensive strategy for eliciting null and alternative sampling prior distributions which are used to define Bayesian generalizations of the traditional notions of type I error control and power. Bayesian type I error control requires that a weighted-average type I error rate not exceed a prespecified threshold. We develop a procedure for generating an appropriately sized Bayesian hypothesis test using a simple partial-borrowing power prior which summarizes the fraction of information borrowed from the historical trial. We present results from simulation studies that demonstrate that a hypothesis test procedure based on this simple power prior is as efficient as those based on more complicated meta-analytic priors, such as normalized power priors or robust mixture priors, when all are held to precise type I error control requirements. We demonstrate our methodology using a real data set to design a follow-up clinical trial with time-to-event endpoint for an investigational treatment in high-risk melanoma.},

   abstract = {The primary objective of a phase II clinical trial of a new drug or regimen is to determine whether it has sufficient biological activity against the disease under study to warrant more extensive development. Such trials are often conducted in a multi-institution setting where designs of more than two stages are difficult to manage. This paper presents two-stage designs that are optimal in the sense that the expected sample size is minimized if the regimen has low activity subject to constraints upon the size of the type 1 and type 2 errors. Two-stage designs which minimize the maximum sample size are also determined. Optimum and “minimax” designs for a range of design parameters are tabulated. These designs can also be used for pilot studies of new regimens where toxicity is the endpoint of interest.},

We argue that a Bayesian approach allows a formal basis for using external evidence and in addition provides a rational way for dealing with issues such as the ethics of randomization, trials to show treatment equivalence, the monitoring of accumulating data and the prediction of the consequences of continuing a study. The motivation for using this methodology is practical rather than ideological.]},
