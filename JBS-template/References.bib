abstract = {We develop a novel two-stage Bayesian adaptive trial design for pediatric settings which borrows information from previously completed trials in adults to support establishing substantial evidence of efficacy for the pediatric population in situations where information extrapolation from adults is justifiable. At the time of the stage I analysis, the extent of information borrowing from adult data is determined by assessing compatibility of the observed pediatric data with its prior predictive distribution, derived using the adult trial data. At this time, the trial may be stopped for futility, enrollment may be stopped (with ongoing patients followed up for primary outcome ascertainment), or enrollment may proceed into stage II to reach a prespecified maximum sample size. We provide guidance on how practitioners can approach answering the question “How much information should be borrowed?” through balancing use of the adult data (when compatible with the pediatric data) with the need to ensure the design leads to reasonable recommendations regarding key actions that might be taken regarding the trial (e.g., when to stop early for efficacy). Type I error control is considered secondary to these considerations as type I error rate inflation above typical levels is unavoidable in these settings. We illustrate how the method can be applied using the Pediatric Lupus Trial of Belimumab Plus Background Standard Therapy as motivation.},

Primary endpoint: SLE Responder Index (SRI4) response rate (Week 52). Key major secondary endpoints: proportion of patients achieving the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation/American College of Rheumatology (PRINTO/ACR) response using 50 and ‘30 alternative' definitions (Week 52), and sustained response (Weeks 44 to 52) by SRI4 and Parent Global Assessment of well-being (Parent-global). Safety and pharmacokinetics were assessed. Study not powered for statistical testing.Results Ninety-three patients were randomised (belimumab, n=53; placebo, n=40). At Week 52, there were numerically more SRI4 responders with belimumab versus placebo (52.8{\%} vs 43.6{\%}; OR 1.49 (95{\%} CI 0.64 to 3.46)). PRINTO/ACR 30 alternative (52.8{\%} vs 27.5{\%}; OR 2.92 (95{\%} CI 1.19 to 7.17)) and PRINTO/ACR 50 (60.4{\%} vs 35.0{\%}; OR 2.74 (95{\%} CI 1.15 to 6.54)) responses were more frequent with belimumab than placebo, as were sustained responses for SRI4 (belimumab, 43.4{\%}; placebo, 41.0{\%}; OR 1.08 (95{\%} CI 0.46 to 2.52)) and Parent-global (belimumab, 59.1{\%}; placebo, 33.3{\%}; OR 3.49 (95{\%} CI 1.23 to 9.91)). Serious adverse events were reported in 17.0{\%} of belimumab patients and 35.0{\%} of placebo patients; one death occurred (placebo). Week-52, geometric mean (95{\%} CI) belimumab trough concentration was 56.2 (45.2 to 69.8) µg/mL.Conclusion The belimumab intravenous pharmacokinetics and benefit–risk profile in cSLE are consistent with adult belimumab studies and the 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks dose is appropriate.Trial registration number NCT01649765.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims We evaluated the efficacy and safety of infliximab for inducing and maintaining benefit in children with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). Methods Patients (6–17 years old) who had active UC (Mayo scores of 6–12; endoscopic subscores ≥2) and had not responded to or tolerated conventional treatment were given 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6. The primary end point was response at week 8 (decreases in Mayo scores ≥30{\%} and ≥3 points and decreases in rectal bleeding subscores of ≥1 or an absolute subscore of ≤1). At week 8, only responders were randomly assigned to groups given infliximab every 8 or 12 weeks (q8w or q12w) and followed through week 54. Maintenance end points included pediatric UC activity index scores 40{\%}). Among responders, twice as many were in remission at week 54 after q8w (8 of 21, 38.1{\%}) than q12w (4 of 22, 18.2{\%}; P = .146) therapy. Assuming the q8w remission rate for responders, the overall remission rate at week 54 would be 28.6{\%}. Serious adverse events and infusion reactions occurred in similar proportions in the q8w and q12w groups. No deaths, malignancies, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, or delayed hypersensitivity reactions were reported. Conclusions Infliximab was safe and effective, inducing a response at week 8 in 73.3{\%} of pediatric patients with moderate to severely active UC who did not respond to conventional therapy. The overall remission rate at week 54 for all enrolled patients was 28.6{\%}, assuming the more effective q8w remission rate.},

abstract = {In the era of precision medicine, novel designs are developed to deal with flexible clinical trials that incorporate many treatment strategies for multiple diseases in one trial setting. This situation often leads to small sample sizes in disease-treatment combinations and has fostered the discussion about the benefits of borrowing of external or historical information for decision-making in these trials. Several methods have been proposed that dynamically discount the amount of information borrowed from historical data based on the conformity between historical and current data. Specifically, Bayesian methods have been recommended and numerous investigations have been performed to characterize the properties of the various borrowing mechanisms with respect to the gain to be expected in the trials. However, there is common understanding that the risk of type I error inflation exists when information is borrowed and many simulation studies are carried out to quantify this effect. To add transparency to the debate, we show that if prior information is conditioned upon and a uniformly most powerful test exists, strict control of type I error implies that no power gain is possible under any mechanism of incorporation of prior information, including dynamic borrowing. The basis of the argument is to consider the test decision function as a function of the current data even when external information is included. We exemplify this finding in the case of a pediatric arm appended to an adult trial and dichotomous outcome for various methods of dynamic borrowing from adult information to the pediatric arm. In conclusion, if use of relevant external data is desired, the requirement of strict type I error control has to be replaced by more appropriate metrics.},

   abstract = {We consider the problem of Bayesian sample size determination for a clinical trial in the presence of historical data that inform the treatment effect. Our broadly applicable, simulation-based methodology provides a framework for calibrating the informativeness of a prior while simultaneously identifying the minimum sample size required for a new trial such that the overall design has appropriate power to detect a non-null treatment effect and reasonable type I error control. We develop a comprehensive strategy for eliciting null and alternative sampling prior distributions which are used to define Bayesian generalizations of the traditional notions of type I error control and power. Bayesian type I error control requires that a weighted-average type I error rate not exceed a prespecified threshold. We develop a procedure for generating an appropriately sized Bayesian hypothesis test using a simple partial-borrowing power prior which summarizes the fraction of information borrowed from the historical trial. We present results from simulation studies that demonstrate that a hypothesis test procedure based on this simple power prior is as efficient as those based on more complicated meta-analytic priors, such as normalized power priors or robust mixture priors, when all are held to precise type I error control requirements. We demonstrate our methodology using a real data set to design a follow-up clinical trial with time-to-event endpoint for an investigational treatment in high-risk melanoma.},

abstract = {Summary Frequentist concepts, such as the control of the type I error or the false discovery rate, are well established in the medical literature and often required by regulators. Most Bayesian designs are defined without explicit considerations of frequentist characteristics. Once the Bayesian design is structured, statisticians use simulations and adjust tuning parameters to comply with a set of targeted operating characteristics. These adjustments affect the use of prior information and utility functions. Here we consider a Bayesian decision theoretic approach for experimental designs with explicit frequentist requisites. We define optimal designs under a set of constraints required by a regulator. Our approach combines the use of interpretable utility functions with frequentist criteria, and selects an optimal design that satisfies a set of required operating characteristics. We illustrate the approach using a group-sequential multi-arm Phase II trial and a bridging trial.},

Simulations show that at fixed total number of events, the proposed design can achieve greater power and require smaller expected event size when appropriate priors are chosen, compared with the frequentist group sequential design.

Simulations show that, at the same sample size, the proposed method provides larger power than the corresponding frequentist sequential design. It also has larger power than traditional Bayesian sequential design which sets equal critical values for all interim analyses. When compared with other alpha spending functions, O?Brien-Fleming alpha spending function has the largest power and is the most conservative in terms that at the same sample size, the null hypothesis is the least likely to be rejected at early stage of clinical trials.
