We propose a Bayesian sequential design for clinical trials with time-to-event outcomes and use alpha spending functions to control the overall type I error rate. Bayes factor is adapted for decision-making at interim analyses. Algorithms are presented to make decision rules and to calculate power of the proposed tests. Sensitivity analysis is implemented to evaluate the impact of different choices of prior parameters on choosing critical values. The power of tests, the expected event size of the proposed design, and the quality of estimators are studied through simulations, and compared with the frequentist group sequential design. Simulations show that at fixed total number of events, the proposed design can achieve greater power and require smaller expected event size when appropriate priors are chosen, compared with the frequentist group sequential design. The feasibility of the proposed design is further illustrated on a real data set.},

We provide algorithms to calculate critical values, power, and sample sizes for the proposed design. Sensitivity analysis is implemented to check the effects from different prior distributions, and conservative priors are recommended. We compare the power and actual sample sizes of the proposed Bayesian sequential design with different alpha spending functions through simulations. We also compare the power of the proposed method with frequentist sequential design using the same alpha spending function. Simulations show that, at the same sample size, the proposed method provides larger power than the corresponding frequentist sequential design. It also has larger power than traditional Bayesian sequential design which sets equal critical values for all interim analyses. When compared with other alpha spending functions, O?Brien-Fleming alpha spending function has the largest power and is the most conservative in terms that at the same sample size, the null hypothesis is the least likely to be rejected at early stage of clinical trials. And finally, we show that adding a step of stop for futility in the Bayesian sequential design can reduce the overall type I error and reduce the actual sample sizes.},

abstract = {Abstract Leveraging preclinical animal data for a phase I oncology trial is appealing yet challenging. In this paper, we use animal data to improve decision-making in a model-based dose-escalation procedure. We make a proposal for how to measure and address a prior-data conflict in a sequential study with a small sample size. Animal data are incorporated via a robust two-component mixture prior for the parameters of the human dose?toxicity relationship. The weights placed on each component of the prior are chosen empirically and updated dynamically as the trial progresses and more data accrue. After completion of each cohort, we use a Bayesian decision-theoretic approach to evaluate the predictive utility of the animal data for the observed human toxicity outcomes, reflecting the degree of agreement between dose?toxicity relationships in animals and humans. The proposed methodology is illustrated through several data examples and an extensive simulation study.},

abstract = {Summary Frequentist concepts, such as the control of the type I error or the false discovery rate, are well established in the medical literature and often required by regulators. Most Bayesian designs are defined without explicit considerations of frequentist characteristics. Once the Bayesian design is structured, statisticians use simulations and adjust tuning parameters to comply with a set of targeted operating characteristics. These adjustments affect the use of prior information and utility functions. Here we consider a Bayesian decision theoretic approach for experimental designs with explicit frequentist requisites. We define optimal designs under a set of constraints required by a regulator. Our approach combines the use of interpretable utility functions with frequentist criteria, and selects an optimal design that satisfies a set of required operating characteristics. We illustrate the approach using a group-sequential multi-arm Phase II trial and a bridging trial.},

abstract = {Abstract We present a Bayesian approach for monitoring multiple outcomes in single-arm clinical trials. Each patient's response may include both adverse events and efficacy outcomes, possibly occurring at different study times. We use a Dirichlet-multinomial model to accommodate general discrete multivariate responses. We present Bayesian decision criteria and monitoring boundaries for early termination of studies with unacceptably high rates of adverse outcomes or with low rates of desirable outcomes. Each stopping rule is constructed either to maintain equivalence or to achieve a specified level of improvement of a particular event rate for the experimental treatment, compared with that of standard therapy. We avoid explicit specification of costs and a loss function. We evaluate the joint behaviour of the multiple decision rules using frequentist criteria. One chooses a design by considering several parameterizations under relevant fixed values of the multiple outcome probability vector. Applications include trials where response is the cross-product of multiple simultaneous binary outcomes, and hierarchical structures that reflect successive stages of treatment response, disease progression and survival. We illustrate the approach with a variety of single-arm cancer trials, including bio-chemotherapy acute leukaemia trials, bone marrow transplantation trials, and an anti-infection trial. The number of elementary patient outcomes in each of these trials varies from three to seven, with as many as four monitoring boundaries running simultaneously. We provide general guidelines for eliciting and parameterizing Dirichlet priors and for specifying design parameters.},

abstract = {[A Phase IIB clinical trial typically is a single-arm study aimed at deciding whether a new treatment E is sufficiently promising, relative to a standard therapy, S, to include in a large-scale randomized trial. Thus, Phase IIB trials are inherently comparative even though a standard therapy arm usually is not included. Uncertainty regarding the response rate $\Theta$s of S is rarely made explicit, either in planning the trial or interpreting its results. We propose practical Bayesian guidelines for deciding whether E is promising relative to S in settings where patient response is binary and the data are monitored continuously. The design requires specification of an informative prior for $\Theta$s, a targeted improvement for E, and bounds on the allowed sample size. No explicit specification of a loss function is required. Sampling continues until E is shown to be either promising or not promising relative to S with high posterior probability, or the maximum sample size is reached. The design provides decision boundaries, a probability distribution for the sample size at termination, and operating characteristics under fixed response probabilities with E.]},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Atezolizumab is a humanised antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-L1 and programmed death-1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 and B7-1 interactions, reinvigorating anticancer immunity. We assessed its efficacy and safety versus docetaxel in previously treated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. METHODS: We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (OAK) in 194 academic or community oncology centres in 31 countries. We enrolled patients who had squamous or non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, were 18 years or older, had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients had received one to two previous cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens (one or more platinum based combination therapies) for stage IIIB or IV non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients with a history of autoimmune disease and those who had received previous treatments with docetaxel, CD137 agonists, anti-CTLA4, or therapies targeting the PD-L1 and PD-1 pathway were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to intravenously receive either atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks by permuted block randomisation (block size of eight) via an interactive voice or web response system. Coprimary endpoints were overall survival in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and PD-L1-expression population TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 (≥1{\%} PD-L1 on tumour cells or tumour-infiltrating immune cells). The primary efficacy analysis was done in the first 850 of 1225 enrolled patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02008227. FINDINGS: Between March 11, 2014, and April 29, 2015, 1225 patients were recruited. In the primary population, 425 patients were randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab and 425 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel. Overall survival was significantly longer with atezolizumab in the ITT and PD-L1-expression populations. In the ITT population, overall survival was improved with atezolizumab compared with docetaxel (median overall survival was 13{\textperiodcentered}8 months [95{\%} CI 11{\textperiodcentered}8-15{\textperiodcentered}7] vs 9{\textperiodcentered}6 months [8{\textperiodcentered}6-11{\textperiodcentered}2]; hazard ratio [HR] 0{\textperiodcentered}73 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}62-0{\textperiodcentered}87], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0003). Overall survival in the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 population was improved with atezolizumab (n=241) compared with docetaxel (n=222; median overall survival was 15{\textperiodcentered}7 months [95{\%} CI 12{\textperiodcentered}6-18{\textperiodcentered}0] with atezolizumab vs 10{\textperiodcentered}3 months [8{\textperiodcentered}8-12{\textperiodcentered}0] with docetaxel; HR 0{\textperiodcentered}74 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}58-0{\textperiodcentered}93]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0102). Patients in the PD-L1 low or undetectable subgroup (TC0 and IC0) also had improved survival with atezolizumab (median overall survival 12{\textperiodcentered}6 months vs 8{\textperiodcentered}9 months; HR 0{\textperiodcentered}75 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}59-0{\textperiodcentered}96]). Overall survival improvement was similar in patients with squamous (HR 0{\textperiodcentered}73 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}54-0{\textperiodcentered}98]; n=112 in the atezolizumab group and n=110 in the docetaxel group) or non-squamous (0{\textperiodcentered}73 [0{\textperiodcentered}60-0{\textperiodcentered}89]; n=313 and n=315) histology. Fewer patients had treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events with atezolizumab (90 [15{\%}] of 609 patients) versus docetaxel (247 [43{\%}] of 578 patients). One treatment-related death from a respiratory tract infection was reported in the docetaxel group. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, OAK is the first randomised phase 3 study to report results of a PD-L1-targeted therapy, with atezolizumab treatment resulting in a clinically relevant improvement of overall survival versus docetaxel in previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer, regardless of PD-L1 expression or histology, with a favourable safety profile.

However, for important practical reasons the form of this data monitoring may vary from trial to trial. Thus a trial addressing what is considered a major question in the treatment of cancer patients, (a 'pivotal' or 'high profile' trial), has a formal data monitoring committee (DMC). This is usually made up of two clinicians and one statistician who are completely independent of the trial organization and do not enter patients into the trial. Other trials, which constitute the majority, are monitored by a less formal trial progress group made up of the clinical co-ordinator and trial statistician, sometimes supplemented by a trial participant. Experience with this dual system has led to a new proposal: if the trial progress group wish to modify or stop a trial then they are required to set up and consult an ad hoc DMC for independent advice. This proposal has many advantages, including maximizing the use of resources available, while achieving the degree of objectivity in decision-making required for the many different types of cancer trials conducted by the CTC.},

Most of these trials are conducted with the objective of demonstrating differences in efficacy of treatments, for example, to show superiority of a new drug or experimental treatment to a control. However, an increasing number of trials are designed to establish equivalence in efficacy or bioequivalence. This paper deals with group sequential test procedures in two-sided equivalence trials. Optimized designs with respect to sample size behaviour are constructed.

abstract = {Abstract A multistage single arm phase II trial with binary endpoint is considered. Bayesian posterior probabilities are used to monitor futility in interim analyses and efficacy in the final analysis. For a beta-binomial model, decision rules based on Bayesian posterior probabilities are converted to “traditional” decision rules in terms of number of responders among patients observed so far. Analytical derivations are given for the probability of stopping for futility and for the probability to declare efficacy. A workflow is presented on how to select the parameters specifying the Bayesian design, and the operating characteristics of the design are investigated. It is outlined how the presented approach can be transferred to statistical models other than the beta-binomial model.},

abstract = {Background {\&} Aims We evaluated the efficacy and safety of infliximab for inducing and maintaining benefit in children with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). Methods Patients (6–17 years old) who had active UC (Mayo scores of 6–12; endoscopic subscores ≥2) and had not responded to or tolerated conventional treatment were given 5 mg/kg infliximab at weeks 0, 2, and 6. The primary end point was response at week 8 (decreases in Mayo scores ≥30{\%} and ≥3 points and decreases in rectal bleeding subscores of ≥1 or an absolute subscore of ≤1). At week 8, only responders were randomly assigned to groups given infliximab every 8 or 12 weeks (q8w or q12w) and followed through week 54. Maintenance end points included pediatric UC activity index scores 40{\%}). Among responders, twice as many were in remission at week 54 after q8w (8 of 21, 38.1{\%}) than q12w (4 of 22, 18.2{\%}; P = .146) therapy. Assuming the q8w remission rate for responders, the overall remission rate at week 54 would be 28.6{\%}. Serious adverse events and infusion reactions occurred in similar proportions in the q8w and q12w groups. No deaths, malignancies, opportunistic infections, tuberculosis, or delayed hypersensitivity reactions were reported. Conclusions Infliximab was safe and effective, inducing a response at week 8 in 73.3{\%} of pediatric patients with moderate to severely active UC who did not respond to conventional therapy. The overall remission rate at week 54 for all enrolled patients was 28.6{\%}, assuming the more effective q8w remission rate.},

abstract = {Abstract Many popular sequential phase II clinical trial designs optimize some criterion subject to constraints on the error probabilities at null and alternative values of the response rate. Such designs may forfeit optimality if one fails to conduct analyses strictly according to plan. Moreover, a decision, say, to accept the experimental therapy at one interim analysis does not necessarily imply the same degree of evidence as the same decision when made at another analysis. I propose an alternative design that bases decisions on the ability of the data to persuade either a sceptic or an enthusiast. My standard of evidence, called the persuasion probability, is based on the Bayesian posterior probability that the experimental treatment is superior to the standard. The design calls for termination at any interim analysis at which an observed persuasion probability exceeds its critical value. I investigate the standards of evidence implied by some frequentist procedures and calculate frequentist properties of persuasion-probability designs. ? 1997 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {AbstractBayesian approaches to the monitoring of group sequential designs have two main advantages compared with classical group sequential designs: first, they facilitate implementation of interim success and futility criteria that are tailored to the subsequent decision making, and second, they allow inclusion of prior information on the treatment difference and on the control group. A general class of Bayesian group sequential designs is presented, where multiple criteria based on the posterior distribution can be defined to reflect clinically meaningful decision criteria on whether to stop or continue the trial at the interim analyses. To evaluate the frequentist operating characteristics of these designs, both simulation methods and numerical integration methods are proposed, as implemented in the corresponding R package gsbDesign. Normal approximations are used to allow fast calculation of these characteristics for various endpoints. The practical implementation of the approach is illustrated with several clinical trial examples from different phases of drug development, with various endpoints, and informative priors.

abstract = {Abstract Objective To assess the efficacy/safety of the B lymphocyte stimulator inhibitor belimumab plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy in active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods In a phase III, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 819 antinuclear antibody?positive or anti?double-stranded DNA?positive SLE patients with scores ≥6 on the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA) version of the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1 mg/kg belimumab, 10 mg/kg belimumab, or placebo intravenously on days 0, 14, and 28 and then every 28 days for 72 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the SLE Responder Index (SRI) response rate at week 52 (an SRI response was defined as a ≥4-point reduction in SELENA?SLEDAI score, no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group [BILAG] A organ domain score and no more than 1 new BILAG B score, and no worsening in physician's global assessment score versus baseline). Results Belimumab at 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy met the primary efficacy end point, generating a significantly greater SRI response at week 52 compared with placebo (43.2{\%} versus 33.5{\%}; P = 0.017). The rate with 1 mg/kg belimumab was 40.6{\%} (P = 0.089). Response rates at week 76 were 32.4{\%}, 39.1{\%}, and 38.5{\%} with placebo, 1 mg/kg belimumab, and 10 mg/kg belimumab, respectively. In post hoc sensitivity analyses evaluating higher SELENA?SLEDAI score thresholds, 10 mg/kg belimumab achieved better discrimination at weeks 52 and 76. Risk of severe flares over 76 weeks (based on the modified SLE Flare Index) was reduced with 1 mg/kg belimumab (34{\%}) (P = 0.023) and 10 mg/kg belimumab (23{\%}) (P = 0.13). Serious and severe adverse events, including infections, laboratory abnormalities, malignancies, and deaths, were comparable across groups. Conclusion Belimumab plus standard therapy significantly improved SRI response rate, reduced SLE disease activity and severe flares, and was generally well tolerated in SLE.},

abstract = {Bayesian statistics, a currently controversial viewpoint concerning statistical inference, is based on a definition of probability as a particular measure of the opinions of ideally consistent people. Statistical inference is modification of these opinions in the light of evidence, and Bayes' theorem specifies how such modifications should be made. The tools of Bayesian statistics include the theory of specific distributions and the principle of stable estimation, which specifies when actual prior opinions may be satisfactorily approximated by a uniform distribution. A common feature of many classical significance tests is that a sharp null hypothesis is compared with a diffuse alternative hypothesis. Often evidence which, for a Bayesian statistician, strikingly supports the null hypothesis leads to rejection of that hypothesis by standard classical procedures. The likelihood principle emphasized in Bayesian statistics implies, among other things, that the rules governing when data collection stops are irrelevant to data interpretation. It is entirely appropriate to collect data until a point has been proven or disproven, or until the data collector runs out of time, money, or patience. (71 ref.)

Overall survival (OS) in the EC-derived control arm was compared with OS in the RCT experimental arm. The primary outcome was OS, defined as time from randomization or treatment initiation (EHR) to death. Cox regression models were used to obtain effect estimates using EHR data. EC-derived hazard ratio estimates aligned closely with those from the corresponding RCT with one exception. Comparing log HRs among all RCT and EC results gave a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86. Properly selected control arms from contemporaneous EHR data could be used to put single-arm trials of OS in advanced non-small cell lung cancer into context.},

However, most previous Bayesian approaches have based the stopping decision on the posterior probability content of one or more regions of the parameter space, thus implicitly determining a loss and decision structure. In this paper, we offer a fully Bayesian approach to this problem, specifying not only the likelihood and prior distributions but appropriate loss functions as well. At each data monitoring point, we enumerate the available decisions and investigate the use of backward induction, implemented via Monte Carlo methods, to choose the optimal course of action. We then present a forward sampling algorithm that substantially eases the analytic and computational burdens associated with backward induction, offering the possibility of fully Bayesian optimal sequential monitoring for previously untenable numbers of interim looks. We show that forward sampling can always identify the optimal sequential strategy in the case of a one-parameter exponential family with a conjugate prior and monotone loss functions as well as the best member of a certain class of strategies when backward induction is infeasible. Finally, we illustrate and compare the forward and backward approaches using data from a recent AIDS clinical trial.},

abstract = {Objectives This ongoing Phase-2, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluated the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of intravenous belimumab in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE).Methods Patients (5 to 17 years) were randomised to belimumab 10 mg/kg intravenous or placebo every 4 weeks, plus standard SLE therapy. Primary endpoint: SLE Responder Index (SRI4) response rate (Week 52). Key major secondary endpoints: proportion of patients achieving the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation/American College of Rheumatology (PRINTO/ACR) response using 50 and ‘30 alternative' definitions (Week 52), and sustained response (Weeks 44 to 52) by SRI4 and Parent Global Assessment of well-being (Parent-global). Safety and pharmacokinetics were assessed. Study not powered for statistical testing.Results Ninety-three patients were randomised (belimumab, n=53; placebo, n=40). At Week 52, there were numerically more SRI4 responders with belimumab versus placebo (52.8{\%} vs 43.6{\%}; OR 1.49 (95{\%} CI 0.64 to 3.46)). PRINTO/ACR 30 alternative (52.8{\%} vs 27.5{\%}; OR 2.92 (95{\%} CI 1.19 to 7.17)) and PRINTO/ACR 50 (60.4{\%} vs 35.0{\%}; OR 2.74 (95{\%} CI 1.15 to 6.54)) responses were more frequent with belimumab than placebo, as were sustained responses for SRI4 (belimumab, 43.4{\%}; placebo, 41.0{\%}; OR 1.08 (95{\%} CI 0.46 to 2.52)) and Parent-global (belimumab, 59.1{\%}; placebo, 33.3{\%}; OR 3.49 (95{\%} CI 1.23 to 9.91)). Serious adverse events were reported in 17.0{\%} of belimumab patients and 35.0{\%} of placebo patients; one death occurred (placebo). Week-52, geometric mean (95{\%} CI) belimumab trough concentration was 56.2 (45.2 to 69.8) µg/mL.Conclusion The belimumab intravenous pharmacokinetics and benefit–risk profile in cSLE are consistent with adult belimumab studies and the 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks dose is appropriate.Trial registration number NCT01649765.},

abstract = {BackgroundIn oncology, the treatment paradigm is shifting toward personalized medicine, where the goal is to match patients to the treatments most likely to deliver benefit. Treatment effects in various subpopulations may provide some information about treatment effects in other subpopulations.PurposeWe compare different approaches to Phase II trial design where a new treatment is being investigated in several groups of patients. We compare considering each group in an independent trial to a single trial with hierarchical modeling of the patient groups.MethodsWe assume four patient groups with different background response rates and simulate operating characteristics of three trial designs, Simon?s Optimal Two-Stage design, a Bayesian adaptive design with frequent interim analyses, and a Bayesian adaptive design with frequent interim analyses and hierarchical modeling across patient groups.ResultsSimon?s designs are based on 10 {\%} Type I and Type II error rates. The independent Bayesian designs are tuned to have similar error rates, but may have a slightly smaller mean sample size due to more frequent interim analyses. Under the null, the mean sample size is 2?4 patients smaller. A hierarchical model across patient groups can provide additional power and a further reduction in mean sample size. Under the null, the addition of the hierarchical model decreases the mean sample size an additional 4?7 patients in each group. Under the alternative hypothesis, power is increased to at least 98 {\%} in all groups.LimitationsHierarchical borrowing can make finding a single group in which the treatment is promising, if there is only one, more difficult. In a scenario where the treatment is uninteresting in all but one group, power for that one group is reduced to 65 {\%} . When the drug appears promising in some groups and not in others, there is potential for borrowing to inflate the Type I error rate.ConclusionsThe Bayesian hierarchical design is more likely to correctly conclude efficacy or futility than the other two designs in many scenarios. The Bayesian hierarchical design is a strong design for addressing possibly differential effects in different groups.},

@article{Berry2006,
abstract = {The greatest virtue of traditional frequentist statistical approaches may be the extreme rigour and narrowness of focus, but a side effect of this virtue is inflexibility, which in turn limits innovation in the design and analysis of clinical trials.Because of this, clinical trials tend to be overly large, which increases the cost of developing new therapeutic approaches, and some patients are unnecessarily exposed to inferior experimental therapies. Bayesian approaches have the potential to address these issues.The defining characteristic of any statistical approach is how it deals with uncertainty. Unlike the frequentist approach, in the Bayesian approach, all uncertainty is measured by probability.The continuous learning that is possible in the Bayesian approach enables investigators to modify trials in midcourse. Modifications include stopping the trial, adaptively assigning patients to therapies that are performing better or that will give more information about the scientific question of interest, and adding and dropping treatment arms.In analysing the results of a clinical trial, the Bayesian attitude is to bring all available information to bear on the scientific question being addressed. Outside of a Bayesian perspective, such potentially important information is usually overlooked because the methodology used cannot incorporate it.The Bayesian approach has several advantages in drug development, such as the process of updating knowledge gradually rather than restricting to large discrete steps measured in trials or phases. Another advantage is that it is specifically tied to decision making, within a particular trial, within a drug development programme, and within establishing a company's portfolio of drugs under development.Therapeutic areas in which the clinical endpoints are observed early stand to benefit most from an increase in the use of Bayesian approaches. Similiarly, diseases such as cancer in which there is a burgeoning number of biomarkers available for assessing the disease's progress will also benefit.},

@article{Berry1993,
abstract = {This paper describes a Bayesian approach to the design and analysis of clinical trials, and compares it with the frequentist approach. Both approaches address learning under uncertainty. But they are different in a variety of ways. The Bayesian approach is more flexible. For example, accumulating data from a clinical trial can be used to update Bayesian measures, independent of the design of the trial. Frequentist measures are tied to the design, and interim analyses must be planned for frequentist measures to have meaning. Its flexibility makes the Bayesian approach ideal for analysing data from clinical trials. In carrying out a Bayesian analysis for inferring treatment effect, information from the clinical trial and other sources can be combined and used explicitly in drawing conclusions. Bayesians and frequentists address making decisions very differently. For example, when choosing or modifying the design of a clinical trial, Bayesians use all available information, including that which comes from the trial itself. The ability to calculate predictive probabilities for future observations is a distinct advantage of the Bayesian approach to designing clinical trials and other decisions. An important difference between Bayesian and frequentist thinking is the role of randomization.},
